# Cannon-style 2D distributed FLmap (map level).
# Design: docs/2026-06-10-cannon-flmap-design.md
#
# Rank (r1, r2) on an N1×N2 grid holds
#   FL block:      FL[a_range(r1), :, :, i_range(r2)]
#   result block:  result[d_range(r1), :, :, l_range(r2)]
# ALu / ALd / M are fully replicated (AL distribution comes with the later
# leftenv integration round). Stage 1 rotates FL blocks along the row ring
# while accumulating the stationary intermediate G; stage 2 contracts with
# ALu and reduce-scatters along the column. Output distribution = input
# distribution, so the map iterates without redistribution.
